## 🤝 Community Response Strategy

When people ask "Why not just use Axum?":
> "Great question! Axum is excellent (rapid-rs is built on it). The difference is Axum is intentionally minimal - you still wire up config, validation, docs, etc. rapid-rs adds the conventions for common use cases. You can still use Axum patterns when needed!"

When people ask "Is this production ready?":
> "Phase 1 MVP is functional and ready for early adopters. I'd recommend starting with non-critical services. Core is solid (built on Axum, sqlx, tower), but the framework is new. Phase 2 (auth, migrations) coming soon!"

---

## 🎉 YOU'VE GOT THIS!
